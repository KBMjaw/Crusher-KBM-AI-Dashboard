# Kannan Blue Metals — Crusher Monitor (PWA)

Installable Progressive Web App for monitoring the jaw crusher and controlling the
feeder VFD through the (future) AI + VFD automation system.

**Status:** frontend prototype running on demo/mock data. No hardware is connected.

Demo login: `admin` / `12345`

## Run locally

No build step — it is plain HTML/CSS/ES modules.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080      # or: npx serve .
# open http://localhost:8080
```

Service worker and install need `http://localhost` or HTTPS.

## Prototype security (read before production use)

Everything below is checked **in the browser** and can be bypassed by anyone with access to the
device or its developer tools. It exists to finalise the UI and workflow, not to protect equipment:

- Login (`admin` / `12345`) and password change — stored per device.
- Settings PIN — only a hash is in the code and it is never shown, but it is verified client-side.
- Audit log — device-local, IPs simulated, editable via browser storage.

When FastAPI is connected, login, PIN verification, setting changes and auditing must be enforced
by the backend (see `docs/API.md`).

## App updates

A new deployment installs in the background. The app then shows **"New version available —
Reload"**; it never reloads on its own. If there is unsaved work (an open dialog or a manual speed
not yet applied) the user is asked to confirm before reloading. Pages still running v1.0/v1.1 are
moved to the new service worker without a reload; their next normal reload shows the new version.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 &
node tests/e2e.cjs                 # end-to-end feature checks (Playwright)
node tests/update.cjs              # new-version banner + upgrade clean-up
node tests/upgrade-from-live.cjs   # upgrade from the live v1.1.1 build (git commit 9e66e12)
node tests/release-check.cjs       # version bumped + all files precached (run before every release)
node tests/layout.cjs              # clipped/overflowing text at 320–1920 px
node tests/a11y.cjs path/to/axe.min.js   # axe-core WCAG 2 A/AA, light + dark
```

## Deploy

Static site, no build step. `vercel.json` sets the service-worker headers; `.vercelignore` keeps
`tests/` out of deployments. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the current setup,
the move to the GitHub → Vercel workflow, and rollback.

## Screens

| Screen | Highlights |
|---|---|
| Login | Company logo, show/hide password, remember me, Install App |
| Dashboard | Crusher status, Feeder AI state, VFD command card (AI state vs VFD command), today's KPIs, camera thumb, recent alerts |
| Machine | Separate **AI DETECTION** and **VFD COMMAND** panels, AUTO/MANUAL (manual only when EMPTY), manual Empty speed with −/+ and slider (40–50 Hz, Apply to send), auto-frequency table, live drive trend, demo simulator |
| Live Camera | Camera 01/02/03, placeholder scene with AI overlay (RTSP via backend later), fullscreen |
| Alerts | Severity filters, unread state, mark all read |
| Analytics & Reports | Tabs **Analytics · Reports · Audit Log**. Today / Yesterday / Custom Date / Daily (month to date) / Weekly / Custom Range; runtime, downtime, AI state duration, VFD trend & stats, manual periods, alerts, OEE; **Download Report** → report type (Operational / Audit Log / Complete) + PDF / Excel / CSV. Audit Log: filter by date, user, role, action, IP; table on desktop, cards on mobile |
| Profile & Settings | Edit name/photo/role, company name, plant, **company logo**, feeder frequencies, support contact, theme, notifications, install, change password, Help & Support, logout with confirmation |

## Control rules (`js/core/control.js`)

- AI state (EMPTY / PARTIAL / FULL) is always detected and shown — manual never hides it.
- AUTO → command = configured frequency for the AI state (default 30 / 37 / 43 Hz).
- MANUAL → only while AI = EMPTY; setpoint clamped to the manual range (default 40–50 Hz).
- AI leaves EMPTY while in MANUAL → control falls back to AUTO (alert raised).
- Crusher not running → feeder command 0 Hz (interlock).
- FULL / PARTIALLY FULL → MANUAL is locked and the manual speed controls are hidden.
- Changing the **Empty** automatic frequency or the manual min/max requires the settings PIN
  (Profile › Feeder frequency settings › Unlock). Applying a new **Manual Empty Speed** on the
  Machine screen also asks for the PIN. One correct PIN opens a **shared 5-minute window**
  (`APP.pinGraceSec`) for both screens; the window is checked again when saving, and logout
  clears it. Switching AUTO/MANUAL itself needs no PIN. 5 wrong PINs → 60 s lockout. Only a hash is in the code.

## Audit log (`js/services/auditService.js`)

Records date/time, user, role, IP, action, details, previous and new value for: login, failed login,
logout, manual override enabled/disabled (incl. automatic return to AUTO by `system`), manual Empty
speed changes, frequency and manual-range changes, PIN verified/incorrect, profile, photo,
password (values never stored), company details, logo, notification and theme/support settings.

**Prototype:** a fresh installation starts with an **empty** log — only actions performed in the app
create records (older builds' example entries are removed on upgrade). Every record is stored in this
browser, marked **Unverified**, and IP addresses are marked **Simulated** in the UI and in exports.
It is not a secure or authoritative audit record. With `APP.dataSource = 'api'` the PWA posts actions to the FastAPI audit service, which
takes user, session, client IP and timestamp from the authenticated request and stores them; the PWA
only displays `GET /api/v1/audit`.

The backend must enforce the same rules; the browser never talks to the VFD.

```

## Connecting the backend later

Set `APP.dataSource = 'api'` and `APP.apiBase` in `js/config.js`. Implement the endpoints in
[docs/API.md](docs/API.md). Push notifications need a VAPID key (`APP.vapidPublicKey`) and a
`/api/v1/push/subscribe` endpoint; the service worker already handles `push` events.

## Prototype limitations

- Login and password change are checked in the browser and stored on the device — not secure.
- Settings, logo and profile photo are stored in this browser's localStorage.
- Camera is a placeholder; Snapshot/Record activate once the stream exists.
- The installed app icon comes from `manifest.webmanifest` (Kannan logo); an uploaded logo
  replaces branding inside the app, browser tab icon and reports, but browsers do not allow
  changing an installed app's icon at runtime.
